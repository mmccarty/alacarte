Library ala Carte Installation Instructions
  
Step 1. Create the Databases.

	1.1 Create the following databases in MySQL:
	
	    ica_development
	    ica_test
	    ica_production 
	    
	    (Be sure to use those names -or whichever names you choose in database.yml)
	
	1.2 Edit the file config/database.yml.example
	
	Copy config/database.yml.example to config/database.yml and edit to reflect your mysql databases and database settings. Verify that the names for database in database.yml match the databases you created in step 1.1
	
	1.3 In the root directory of your application, run the following command:
	
	    rake db:migrate
	
	You *should* see messages scrolling by indicating tables have been created. If you have any errors in your DB information inputted in the first step, you will see them now.

Step 2. Configure Environments Variables

	Open the configuration file: config/environment.rb
	
	2.1 Add Action Mailer variables
	
	You will need to specify some additional configuration to tell ActionMailer? which SMTP server will handle your outgoing e-mail. Your system administrator will be able to give you the settings for these parameters.
	
	2.2 Add Recaptch API Keys
	
	Add your recaptcha api keys to the #recaptcha variables section
	
	2.3 OPTIONAL: Edit module types
	
	Library ala Carte comes with a default list of module types activated. There are three additional module types that need extra configuration: LibraryFind, Database, Course Reserves.
	See this documentation about activating those modules: http://rubyforge.org/docman/?group_id=6732

Step 3. Edit the course subjects and research department values:

    lib/subjects.txt 

	Edit the course subject codes to reflect the codes specific to your institution.  
	The codes in subjects.txt by default are specific to Oregon State University 
	courses.  The file format is subject code then tab then subject name, one per line; use subjects.txt as an example.
	
	lib/masters.txt 
	
	Edit the research subjects to reflect the departments specific to your institution.  
	The values in masters.txt by default are specific to Oregon State University 
	departments.  The file format is one subject value per line; use masters.txt as an example.

Step 4. Run the install script.

	In the root directory of the application, type:
	
	    script/install
	
	This will populate the subjects and masters table with the values found in lib/subjects.txt and lib/maters.txt respectively.
	As well as create the default admin user:
	
	    email: admin@your-domain.com 
	    password: adm!n

Step 5. Run The ala Carte Tool

	At this time the ala Carte tool should be installed. Enter the URL for your specific installation and login with the default admin account. Once logged in, change the password and email address, by clicking "My Account"
	The admin can then use the admin interface to finish setting up the templates.
